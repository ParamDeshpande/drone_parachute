researched into components, added datasheets in the repository.

Soldered bluepill now testing blinkled code.

5/1/20
4.00 PM 
Checking which code runs for IMU localization.
7.36 PM 
Memory overflow for the ic with kriswiner code.

6/1/20
12.49 PM 
Cannot upload via stlink via arduino IDE coz of DFU issue trying in vscode.
s1 only testing the serial on bluepill.
1.13 PM 
Serial doesnt seem to work with arduino at all rxtx pins tried all combiantions LED blink works.
7.57 PM 
ARM MBED COOMUNCICATION SEEMED TO WORK COZ IT WAS PROPRITERY content. Wont work with ARDUINO, got the FTDI usb to serial IC.
Now testing../tested doesnt seem to work.
However shows blinking led when chars sent via serial terminal.
9.46 PM 
WOLF CRY.
ARDUINO SUCKS LIKE SHIT ... 
FTDI works like charm via MBED.
Looking for mbed compatible mpu9250 codes.
10.20 PM
Fuuny thing the code works on bluepill the kriswiner one ... sadly occupies about 99percent memory.
If things are to go right, I need to REMOVE ALL COMMENTS FROM ALL CODES AND MAKE IT AS SMALL AND AS COMPACT AS POSSIBLE.

11.07 PM 
That above statement a joke. 
Need to buy a bigger MCU, atleast with a bigger memory.

10.02AM
TODAY TASKS 
s1. TEST ax,ay,az kriswiner
s2. TEST servo motor see how much memory ?
s3. Look for alternate boards with higher memory.

10.44 AM 
s1 done 99.8% memory occupied now moving on to servo.
3.31 PM 
FOUND that bluepill supports 128kb flash despite written 64kb.
BUT ARM MBED DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT.
2 ways 
1.Find a hack to work with arm mbed 
2.PORT the entire project to stm32duino.

8.37 PM 
Numerous attempts in progress to make the size to 128KB
Few of them namely are editing some stm32 file in openocd and some file in platfoemio 
ref https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/b18c51/tip_how_to_increase_default_flash_size_for/
Didnt work fully.
Attempt 2 
Trying this option.

9.23 PM
So far both tests seem unsuccessful.
Trying the apporach to use F103R8t6 board code, ( a nucleo variant now looking if it works the same)...
If works rhe same HAPPY and joyous.
If not BACK here.

HAVING FUCKED UP UPDATES MOVING TO WINDOWS TO SEE IF THINGS TURN CORRECT, PIO UPDATES IN PARTICULAR.

10.50 PM 
Started testing for link2,

5.10 PM
Successfully ported the code on arduino framework with bolderflight's MPU lib, Now moving on to code testing of remaining components.
components testing
1. SERVO.
2. RELAY.


5.43 PM
Completed the servo test, moving on to relay test.

6.04 PM 
Even relay seems to work good.
NOW TO FUSE THEM ALL TOGETHER.

9.14 PM
WROTE CODE SKELETON... 
Writing the other half.
PS arduino uses sysTick to calc time, didnt knew that.
Remaining 
1.check_state
2.deploy chute

3.28 PM
MAYBE I MESSED UP WITH GIT 
LOST LOG OF 5 DAYS (yesterday night)
ANYWAYS continuing building gpb since morning

11/1/20
8.15 PM 
Finished nearly the gpb all solder connections good, Havent yet solderded the ic.
Also restored the comments from a previous commit, lost captains log for 8th and 9th JAN.
SED.
To do ... finish testing everything by tonight.
S1. CHECK THE MAIN CODE, see if it works on the GPB 
Work on it first, then move to bluetooth. 
s2. REPEAT STEP 1 until finished.
s3. TEST bluetooth.
S4. SLEEP PROBABLY.

Completed the PCB design alongwith GERBER files.
